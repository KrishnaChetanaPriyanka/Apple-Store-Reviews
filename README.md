# 📊 Apple Store Reviews Analysis

This project is a **statistical analysis of Apple Store product reviews**, focusing on user behavior, satisfaction, and engagement. By applying **descriptive and inferential statistics**, I extracted meaningful insights from app ratings, purchases, and review interactions.  


## 🔍 Overview  
The dataset contains key review metrics such as:  
- ⭐ App ratings  
- 💰 Purchase amounts  
- 👍 Likes on reviews

The analysis explores **patterns in user satisfaction** and **relationships between review features**, supported by clear visualizations.  


## 🎯 Objectives  

### 1. Descriptive Analysis  
- Calculate **mean, median, and mode** of app ratings  
- Measure data spread using **range and interquartile range (IQR)**  
- Compute **variance and standard deviation** for likes on reviews  

### 2. Inferential Analysis  
- Assess the **correlation** between likes and ratings  
- Perform a **hypothesis test** comparing the average ratings of Instagram vs WhatsApp  
- Demonstrate the **Central Limit Theorem** using sampling distributions  

### 3. Visualization  
- Plot distributions of app ratings  
- Identify **trends in user satisfaction**  
- Use graphs for clearer insights  


## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
